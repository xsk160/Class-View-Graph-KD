# Class-View-Graph-KD

This repository contains the code for the paper titled **"Class-View Graph Knowledge Distillation: A New Idea for Learning MLPs on Graphs."**

The core method introduced in this paper is implemented in **Class-View.py**, which presents a novel **class-view knowledge distillation paradigm**. This approach can be integrated into any graph knowledge distillation framework to enhance the prediction performance of the student MLP while simultaneously reducing the training time required for knowledge distillation.

Furthermore, the flexibility of this paradigm allows you to adapt and apply it at suitable points within your existing codebase, depending on your specific requirements.

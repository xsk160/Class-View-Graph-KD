# Class-View-Graph-KD
This is the code for the paper "Class-View Graph Knowledge Distillation: A New Idea for Learning MLPs on Graphs."

Class-View.py is the core loss function in this paper, which is a plug-and-play encapsulated module. You can use it in any graph knowledge distillation framework to further improve the prediction performance of the student MLP while reducing the training time of knowledge distillation.
